Sadly while goku was a child, he accidently killed Gohan during his rage as a great ape and only found out once he fought Vegeta in his great ape form. Over the years, Goku continued to grow stronger and protected the earth from serious threats like King Piccolo, Prince Vegeta, Cell, and Majin Buu and many more to come. He has even defeated emperor Frieza. Goku loves a good and fair fight and has made many friends and enemies. He has been seen in lots of media and is easily the most reconizable anime and manga character there is today.</h3>"
